## What is Sentiment?
Sentiment is journaling app that uses machine learning to classify the emotions of its entries to help the user track their mental state. Created by a group of students interning with the [C4G program at the Colorado Schools of Mines](https://cstart.mines.edu/c4g/), Sentiment was created in the hopes that it could help its user to more activily manage their emotions. Though the internship is officialy over, this project is still in development.
